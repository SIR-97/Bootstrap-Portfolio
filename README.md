# Bootstrap-Portfolio

For this challenge I composed HTML and CSS files in order to create a sample professional portfolio page which I will be able to use over time to develop my own personal portfolio of work. I utilised skills learnt int the first two weeks of the bootcamp and have included the following requirments:

- The Site is divided into several sections: My Work, My skills, About me and Contact Info (footer).
- Navigation links are functional. If a user clicks on any of these sections at the top of the page, then they will be taken to the relevant section.
- I have included an avatar in my hero section.
- The projects presented under the My Work section are the same as those provided in the challenge breif and are not currently functional. As I work on more projects and applications, then these will be changed to working deployed links that are full functional.   
- The page has been styled for multiple screen sizes such as for tablets and mobile phones.
- I  have included hover over effects for the links in the footer.
